Boundary testing is the process of testing between extreme ends or boundaries between partitions of the input values.
•	So these extreme ends like Start- End, Lower- Upper, Maximum-Minimum, Just Inside-Just Outside values are called boundary values and the testing is called "boundary testing".
•	The basic idea in normal boundary value testing is to select input variable values at their:
	1.	Minimum
	2.	Just above the minimum
	3.	A nominal value
	4.	Just below the maximum
	5.	Maximum
